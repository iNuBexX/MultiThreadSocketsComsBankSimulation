# MultiThreadSocketsComsBankSimulation

this here is a project made for the psr subject by ben mansour mahdi
Do note that all of this code is not industry oriented but is instsead made for the sake of experimentation
mainly with multithread programming aka parallel processing and sockets tcp communication over lan 

# Bank Simulation

in the context of multithreading  subject in the second year of engineering in enicarthage 
i (inube) have been assigned this project which is basically a simulation of a local bank agency responsible of keeping 
accounts data including account ribs their solde and status (negative or positive)
more details in the pdf in this repository 



# Notes

## notes and optimization for the future :
+in the future i will add a little bit of coding to make use of the arp algorithms for automatic detection of the open sockets serving this application
from the client side 
+also a better file management method is in order 
+eliminate the os cls methods as they are windows specific 
update the guy / ibuild for linux users and fix the mobile apk app
+update the apk to google drive and add it to this repo
